abstract: 'Previous research on motor sequence learning (MSL) in the elderly has focused
  mainly on unilateral tasks, even though bilateral coordination might be impaired
  in this age group. In this fMRI study, 28 right-handed elderly subjects were recruited.
  The paradigm consisted of a Novel and a simple Control sequence executed with the
  right (R), left (L) and both hands (B). Behavioral performance (Accuracy[AC], Inter-tap
  Interval[ITI]) and associated brain activity were assessed during early learning.
  Behavioral performance in the Novel task was similar between unilateral conditions
  whereas in the bimanual condition more errors and slower motor execution were observed.
  Brain activity increases during learning showed differences between Conditions:
  R showed increased activity in pre-SMA, basal ganglia and left hippocampus while
  B showed activity increments mainly in posterior parietal cortex and cerebellum.
  L did not show any activity modulation during learning. Performance correlates for
  AC (related to spatial success) and ITI (related to accurate timing) shared a cortico-basal-cerebellar
  network. However, it was found that the ITI regressor presented additional significant
  correlations with activity in SMA and basal ganglia in R. The AC regressor showed
  additional significant correlations with activity in more extended thalamic and
  cerebellar areas in B. The present findings suggest that, behaviorally, the spatial
  and temporal components of MSL are impaired in elderly subjects when using both
  hands. Additionally, differential brain activity patterns were found across hand
  modalities. The results obtained reveal the existence of a highly specialized network
  in the dominant hand and identify areas specifically involved in bimanual coordination.'
