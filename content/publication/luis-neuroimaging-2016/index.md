abstract: "BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a progressive dementia\
  \ characterized by focal atrophy of frontal and/or temporal lobes caused by mutations\
  \ in the gene coding for sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), among other genes. Rare SQSTM1\
  \ gene mutations have been associated with Paget's disease of bone, amyotrophic\
  \ lateral sclerosis, and, more recently, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD).\
  \ OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine whether a characteristic pattern\
  \ of grey and white matter loss is associated with SQSTM1 dysfunction. METHODS:\
  \ We performed a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study in FTD subjects carrying SQSTM1\
  \ pathogenic variants (FTD/SQSTM1 mutation carriers; n = 10), compared with FTD\
  \ subjects not carrying SQSTM1 mutations (Sporadic FTD; n = 20) and healthy controls\
  \ with no SQSTM1 mutations (HC/SQSTM1 noncarriers; n = 20). The groups were matched\
  \ according to current age, disease duration, and gender. RESULTS: After comparing\
  \ FTD/SQSTM1 carriers with Sporadic FTD, a predominantly right cortical atrophy\
  \ pattern was localized in the inferior frontal, medial orbitofrontal, precentral\
  \ gyri, and the anterior insula. White matter atrophy was found in both medial and\
  \ inferior frontal gyri, pallidum, and putamen. FTD/SQSTM1 carriers compared with\
  \ HC/SQSTM1 noncarriers showed atrophy at frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes\
  \ of both hemispheres whereas the MRI pattern found in Sporadic FTD compared with\
  \ controls was frontal and left temporal lobe atrophy, extending toward parietal\
  \ and occipital lobes of both hemispheres. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that\
  \ fronto-orbito-insular regions including corticospinal projections as described\
  \ in ALS are probably more susceptible to the damaging effect of SQSTM1 mutations\
  \ delineatinga specific gene-linked atrophy pattern."
