abstract: The human brain undergoes structural and functional changes across the lifespan.
  The study of motor sequence learning in elderly subjects is of particularly interest
  since previous ﬁndings in young adults might not replicate during later stages of
  adulthood. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study assessed
  the performance, brain activity and functional connectivity patterns associated
  with motor sequence learning in late middle adulthood. For this purpose, a total
  of 25 subjects were evaluated during early stages of learning [i.e., fast learning
  (FL)]. A subset of these subjects (n = 11) was evaluated after extensive practice
  of a motor sequence [i.e., slow learning (SL) phase]. As expected, late middle adults
  improved motor performance from FL to SL. Learning-related brain activity patterns
  replicated most of the ﬁndings reported previously in young subjects except for
  the lack of hippocampal activity during FL and the involvement of cerebellum during
  SL. Regarding functional connectivity, precuneus and sensorimotor lobule VI of the
  cerebellum showed a central role during improvement of novel motor performance.
  In the sample of subjects evaluated, connectivity between the posterior putamen
  and parietal and frontal regions was signiﬁcantly decreased with aging during SL.
  This agerelated connectivity pattern may reﬂect losses in network efﬁciency when
  approaching late adulthood. Altogether, these results may have important applications,
  for instance, in motor rehabilitation programs.
