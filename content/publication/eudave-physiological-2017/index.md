abstract: In this pilot study, we aimed to explore the sense of presence and the physiological
  response evoked by an immersive virtual environment by using a modern head-mounted
  display (HMD) while performing a driving task in our simulator. We found an increase
  in mean whole session electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) as well as
  during emergency maneuvers events, showing a stronger response and more extended
  response when driving in the immersive simulation when compared with the standard
  simulation. At this proof of concept phase we were able to register and detect physiological
  signal differences between display modalities, suggesting deeper sense of presence
  when driving in an immersive environment.
