abstract: 'Finding communication strategies that can effectively motivate social distancing
  continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic as
  people around the world wait to be vaccinated. This cross-country preregistered
  experiment (n=25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable
  positive and negative outcomes of different motivational messages encouraging social
  distancing that either promoted personal agency (i.e., autonomy supportive), or
  pressured people with shaming and blaming tactics (i.e., controlling). Participants
  were randomly assigned to three conditions: an autonomy-supportive message promoting
  reflective choices, a controlling message that was restrictive and shaming, or no
  message, which functioned to capture the real-life communications participants had
  been receiving. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses: the controlling
  message elicited more defiance relative to the autonomy-supportive message and increased
  controlled motivation (engaging in social distancing out of guilt and fear of social
  consequences) relative to no message, but messages did not influence behavioral
  intentions. Additionally, motivation to engage in social distancing out of guilt
  and fear of consequences correlated with more defiance and less long-term behavioral
  intentions to engage in social distancing, whereas motivation to engage in social
  distancing out of a true understanding of why the rules are important and necessary
  yielded the opposite patterns. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm
  of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication.'
