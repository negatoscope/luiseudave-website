 abstract = {Finding communication strategies that can effectively motivate social distancing continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic as people around the world wait to be vaccinated. This cross-country preregistered experiment (n=25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable positive and negative outcomes of different motivational messages encouraging social distancing that either promoted personal agency (i.e., autonomy supportive), or pressured people with shaming and blaming tactics (i.e., controlling). Participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: an autonomy-supportive message promoting reflective choices, a controlling message that was restrictive and shaming, or no message, which functioned to capture the real-life communications participants had been receiving. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses: the controlling message elicited more defiance relative to the autonomy-supportive message and increased controlled motivation (engaging in social distancing out of guilt and fear of social consequences) relative to no message, but messages did not influence behavioral intentions. Additionally, motivation to engage in social distancing out of guilt and fear of consequences correlated with more defiance and less long-term behavioral intentions to engage in social distancing, whereas motivation to engage in social distancing out of a true understanding of why the rules are important and necessary yielded the opposite patterns. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication.},
