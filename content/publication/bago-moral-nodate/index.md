abstract: The study of moral judgements is often centered on moral dilemmas in which
  options consistent with deontological perspectives (i.e., emphasizing rules, individual
  rights and duties) are in conflict with options consistent with utilitarian judgements
  (i.e., following the greater good defined through consequences). In a seminal study
  of this field, Greene et al. (2009) showed that psychological and situational factors
  (e.g., the intent of the agent or the presence of physical contact between the agent
  and the victim) can play an important role in moral dilemma judgements. As their
  study was conducted with US samples, our knowledge is limited concerning the universality
  of this effect, in general, and the impact of culture on the situational and psychological
  factors of moral judgements, in particular. Here, we empirically test the universality
  of intent and personal force on moral dilemma judgements by testing the replicability
  of the experiments of Greene et al. on a large (N = X,XXX) and diverse sample across
  the world. We hypothesize that intent and personal force universally increase the
  unacceptability of outcome-maximizing harm in these dilemmas, and that the effect
  is stronger in collectivistic than in individualistic cultures due to cultural differences
  in emotional processing (guilt, shame, anxiety). The relevance of this exploration
  to a broad range of policy-making problems is discussed.
